I used a 0.6mm resistance band, cut a strip to ~10mm

Take the "knob_top_pin" and put the "rod_core" through it. There should be no friction. Make sure the orientation is correct.

The rod core should depress fully into the knob top.

Add on the "cap_top_tensioner" and rotate it so the triangles and slots match.

Press on the "rod_stopper_top" (of your width choice, wider = more tension, I'd recommend medium if you are using similar elastics). Make sure the slot is aligned. There should be some friction, but dont break the parts.

This part sucks and I'm sorry.
Thread a string through the slots, tie it to the end of the elastic, and pull the elastic through (folded in half).

Add a shim to both ends, pull on the elastic so the shims stay in. Tension will be adjusted later.

Add the 4mm spacer, then the first "ejector_outside". Make sure the indents on the rod stopper and the ejector are lined up.
![resized_20241114_150126](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd4e99ac-9db2-4f9a-af56-fab8115b2f56)

Add 10mm spacer, ejector middle, 10mm spacer, ejector top. Keep the indendts aligned.

Take the "rod_stopper_bottom" and push a piece of 12mm cut filament into one side (I recommend the flat side).
![resized_20241114_150258](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/93815161-23e8-489c-b1fb-f1843fa2d060)

Press this onto the remaining rod core, and push/hammer the rod core from the other end to make it flat with the bottom of the bottom stopper.

Press in the filament through the rod core.

Now add on the first layer of "dart_platform" parts, they will only fit in one direction.
![resized_20241114_150452](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8290ed0d-b254-42bc-b232-16c106742994)

Add the remaining layers of platforms, the top might take some work because it must go under the lip of the bottom stopper.

Add on the "cap_bottom". You can now tension the elastic to your liking. To "prime" the grenade, rotate the knob counter-clockwise and push down. The number of rotations you want will depend on your elastic tension, top stopper width, print tolerances, and dart width.
