I used a 0.6mm resistance band, cut a strip to ~10mm

Start by assembling the "rod_stopper_top", "rod_spacer_4mm", and "ejector" onto the "rod_core" with the notch through the top clear

It should looks like this

Now fold the elastic and put it through one side of the "tensioner_cap"
![resized_20241112_090158](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/458cd54a-70ef-4803-b1db-52b3e8ccfe94)

Take the rod and put it into the cap, make sure the shapes line up like this:

Thread the elastic through the rod, then the other side of the tensioner
![resized_20241112_090726](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/345957be-b03d-4f0f-bcde-bb420791cd7b)

Add a "shim" on one side, and pull the elastic from the other side

Do this for the other side too, rotate the rod to pull in the shim. the elastic should not be too tight, just enough to hold the shims in

Next assemble three "dart_platform" pieces into a hexagon, make sure the dart barrels are in the correct direction. Clip them around the "ejector" and then add a "rod_spacer_8mm" on top, followed by the "ejector_middle", and put the next layer on, it will be rotated 60 degrees from the first layer

Add another 8mm spacer, then the final layer, then a 4mm spacer, and finally the "rod_stopper_bottom"
![resized_20241112_115938](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/83b3e3e6-7331-4fb0-81d2-704c2ad1f491)

Clip on the "bottom_cap" and the "knob_bottom"
![resized_20241112_121720](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7236efa9-9a5f-435d-ba09-25c5a81c8033)

Now you can rotate the bottom knob clockwise, and place the "knob_top_pin" on the other side to lock the rotation. If it doesnt lock, take off the bottom knob and put some paper/tape on the end of the rod core and re-attach the bottom knob. Do this until there is enough rod core sticking out the top for the top knob to grab and hold.
