# Hardware:
- 6mm ID, 9mm OD slingshot elastic (or similar). I specifically used this: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DL6JJZ2
- Lube

# Print settings:
- knob top pin - 5 walls, 20% infill
- ejector outside/middle, rod stopper top, rod core - 100% infill
- TPU skin: cap and cozy - 2 walls, 10% gyroid infill
- everything else - 3 walls, 15% infill

Some parts need supports


# Assembly:

Start by cutting a length of the rubber, make a very long diagonal cut, ideally 2.5" long diagonal. You can make the whole length as long as you want, the tapered end can be reused and we will trim it later.

Tie as tight a knot as you can in the opposite end.
![20250306_082106](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/394e098a-20dd-4e34-8681-6f0f48f45a92)

Align the rod core and the knob top pin like this.
![20250306_083009](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/50c4f547-eee1-41b4-97c8-90d5c2524ede)

Put them in the rod stopper top like this, so the knob does not sit flush with the top, and you can see through the whole slit.
![20250306_083037](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a1f04a5f-7a46-432d-b1b1-805d13e0d651)

Drop some lube into the slot on the cap top tensioner.
![20250306_084015](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0cede5d7-ec43-4899-a9b8-979d16a1ddff)

Put the cap top tensioner onto the rod core so that the tab at the top lines up with the slot on the knob

![20250306_090650](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bad64590-93e3-405a-88ff-d67ea372d943)

Slide the rubber through, we'll tie another know and trip it later. Also make note of the position of the dot.
![20250306_090751](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a014247-b9d2-44e2-ad62-354698c78709)

Find one of the "ejector outside" parts based on the location of the dot.
![20250306_090856](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/501cb246-2a0a-47d9-8a5c-e219c5f9525a)

Add the 4mm spacer and ejector outside part, line up the dots.
![20250306_090937](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0194edcb-5262-4df5-8417-7b4093780491)

Add a 10mm spacer, and the ejector middle.
![20250306_090954](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/706a2683-6962-457d-a1e5-94c5ca4e5256)

Another 10mm spacer, and finally the last ejector outside.
![20250306_091007](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5a369f87-88f8-408c-94d6-fd78cc426319)

Now put on the rod stopper bottom, make sure it aligns with the hole in the rod core.
![20250306_091036](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7a267cd-7ab0-4bc9-b1f2-5c8321e192b3)

Cut an 11mm length of filament.
![20250306_084948](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fcff9bd7-1d2c-4508-bd35-bf0cd57711ab)

And press it into the hole.
![20250306_091119](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/864bdf42-9f9f-446a-b830-4e8673f14611)

Now we build the stack of "barrels" using the dart platform parts. You can mix different amounts of the "loose" and "tight" versions to adjust the timing of the grenade. I'll go over this more in the tuning section. To start with, use all tight ones.
![20250306_091655](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df3ad0d8-708a-4eb8-a3cb-314397791f9b)

![20250306_091800](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/82a8df6e-d7d1-4916-9a51-aea0df9f6bc2)

The last layer may take a little finesse to press in place.
![20250306_091851](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d88f58ec-c579-4f41-82d0-35880c436099)

Put on the bottom cap.
![20250306_091900](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b1a9da0d-7968-4ca7-bf88-1567e7a5b4ed)

Now we can tie the other end of the rubber. Try not to get air trapped in the knot. You want about 1.25" of stretch when its pulled tight. Basically make it as tight as you can.
![20250306_092429](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e7691f31-312c-494d-9176-9042ca63c04e)

Trim the ends.
![20250306_092739](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d411880e-8cf4-4b56-b967-bc5279a28784)

The rest of the rubber can be used for the next grenade

# How to use it
To prime the grenade, twist the top and push down. The knob will sit flush with the top cap and lock the rotation.
I recommend rotating it two notches (180 degrees).

# Tuning
Start by priming the grenade by rotating the knob 180 degrees, loading it with the darts you normally use, then pulling the cap and seeing how long it takes to fire darts.

## Detonates too fast
If the darts are flying too soon, use more "dart platform tight" segments, or loosen the rubber.

## Detonates too slow
If it takes too long, or doesn't detonate at all you have a few options.

- Tighten the rubber. If it's already tight, the rubber may be too weak, or you need to try one of the other options.
- Replace "tight" dart platform segments with "loose" ones. The ideal ratio for me ended up being 6 tight and 3 loose.
- Use worn darts. Fresh darts out of the box will be wider than used darts, and thus slower.

Ideally, you want 1 or 2 seconds before detonation. This grenade works best as an air-burst. Remember that you can always cook the grenade in your hand before throwing it.
